## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the environment: `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Download the dataset:**
   - Get `creditcard.csv` from: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
   - Place it in `data/raw/creditcard.csv`
   - The file will be automatically tracked with Git LFS
6. Run tests: `pytest`

## Usage

- Data preprocessing: Run scripts in `src/data/`
- Feature engineering: Use modules in `src/features/`
- Model training: Execute scripts in `src/models/`
- Deployment: Use configurations in `deployment/`

## Contributing

Follow standard Git workflow. Ensure tests pass before merging.
